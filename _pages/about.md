I am Victor, a third-year student at NYU Abu Dhabi majoring in Interactive Media and minoring in Theater and Psychology. I am passionate about the intersection between art and technology and how we can change the world through it, being through programming, 3D modeling, or designing. This website serves as my portfolio for the class "Introduction to Digital Humanities", where I will be posting assignments and reading reflections. For more information, you can contact me at my email: va2269@nyu.edu.
