**Reflection on Digital Literacy as a 22-Year-Old Liberal Arts University Student**

As a 22-year-old university student majoring in Interactive Media at a liberal arts institution, digital literacy is not just a skill set, it’s a lens through which I navigate my academic, creative, and social environments. In an era where technology permeates every aspect of life, being digitally literate means more than knowing how to use a computer or post on social media. Digital literacy is about understanding how to critically engage with digital tools, create meaningful content, and analyze data in ways that improve my interdisciplinary studies. My journey through digital literacy has been shaped by my exposure to technology since an early age, specifically from my earliest memories where I was using a computer with Windows XP to play video games and watch YouTube videos. Consequently, this has impacted my experience in diverse fields such as Web Development, Design, Film, and Interactive Media in general. Each of these fields have contributed to my evolving understanding of how digital tools can transform the way I think, create, and collaborate.

In my daily life, I employ a variety of digital tools for content creation. These tools range from Graphic Design platforms and software such as Figma for web design, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Canva for general graphic design, as well as other tools such as Visual Studio Code for coding, Blender for 3D modeling, Unity for game development, and Premiere for video editing. These tools allow me to use my creativity into the digital world, whether I’m crafting a short film, designing a poster or a wireframe, or producing a multimedia presentation for class. Moreover, in Introduction to Digital Humanities, I was introduced to the concept of “distant reading,” which uses computational methods to analyze large volumes of text. By using tools such as Voyant and R, I can identify patterns in texts that would be impossible to detect through close reading alone. For example, I have recently analyzed the corpus of three different Facebook groups of students from NYUAD, bringing a new understanding of our student body, especially looking at dynamics between gendered and non-gendered spaces. Therefore, we were able to draw conclusions about the language used in these forums, and how they might reflect larger societal and institutional principles. 

On the same note, one of the most exciting aspects of studying at a liberal arts university is the opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration. Working with students from different fields has expanded my understanding of “computational thinking,” as described by Berry and Fagerjord. This cognitive practice involves not just technical skills but also practical wisdom and reflection on how computation can be used to solve problems and create new knowledge. Collaboration has also taught me the importance of approaching data and AI with a critical eye. In a world where algorithms shape everything from social media feeds to hiring practices, it is crucial to understand how these systems work and how they can be biased.

Therefore, as I reflect on my current abilities, I realize that while I’ve made significant progress in digital literacy, there is still much to learn. I am particularly curious about the potential of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in storytelling and art. How might these technologies transform the way we experience narratives or interact with historical artifacts? In terms of computational thinking, I want to deepen my understanding of programming languages such as Python and R, as well as explore new tools for data visualization and analysis. I’m also interested to learn more about the ethical dimensions of AI and how I can use these technologies responsibly in my creative and academic work. Ultimately, I see digital literacy as a lifelong journey, one that requires continuous learning, critical reflection, and a willingness to embrace new ways of thinking. By combining the strengths of my liberal arts education with the possibilities of digital tools, I hope to push the boundaries of what I can achieve as a student, creator, and thinker.
