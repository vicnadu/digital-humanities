**Reflection on Digital Literacy as a 22-Year-Old Liberal Arts University Student**

As a 22-year-old university student majoring in Interactive Media at a liberal arts institution, digital literacy is not just a skill set, it’s a lens through which I navigate my academic, creative, and social environments. In an era where technology permeates every aspect of life, being digitally literate means more than knowing how to use a computer or post on social media. Digital literacy is about understanding how to critically engage with digital tools, create meaningful content, and analyze data in ways that improve my interdisciplinary studies. My journey through digital literacy has been shaped by my exposure to technology since an early age, specifically from my earliest memories where I was using a computer with Windows XP to play video games and watch YouTube videos. Consequently, this has impacted my experience in diverse fields such as Web Development, Design, Film, and Interactive Media in general. Each of these fields has contributed to my evolving understanding of how digital tools can transform the way I think, create, and collaborate.

In my daily life, I employ a variety of digital tools for content creation. These tools range from Graphic Design platforms and software such as Figma for web design, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Canva for general graphic design, as well as other tools such as Visual Studio Code for coding, Blender for 3D modeling, Unity for game development, and Premiere for video editing. These tools allow me to use my creativity in the digital world, whether crafting a short film, designing a poster or a wireframe, or producing a multimedia presentation for class. Moreover, in Introduction to Digital Humanities, I was introduced to the concept of “distant reading,” which uses computational methods to analyze large volumes of text. By using tools such as Voyant and R, I can identify patterns in texts that would be impossible to detect through close reading alone. For example, I have recently analyzed the corpus of three different Facebook groups of students from NYUAD, bringing a new understanding of our student body, especially looking at dynamics between gendered and non-gendered spaces. Therefore, we were able to draw conclusions about the language used in these forums, and how they might reflect larger societal and institutional principles.

Since Assignment 2, my understanding of data has shifted from seeing it as neutral or objective to recognizing its constructed, contingent nature. The concept of “thick mapping,” which I applied in the Zanzibar Gazette project, taught me how layering multiple datasets can reveal hidden patterns and power dynamics in historical sources. Yet, as the assignment showed, the process of structuring, cleaning, and visualizing data is itself interpretive and political, as well as being flawed not only because of human errors but also because of the limitations of AI. On one hand, large language models such as ChatGPT have become noticeably better at generating coherent, context-aware text, and tools like Perplexity Pro can handle certain extraction tasks with impressive speed and complexity. On the other hand, these systems still struggle with scale, nuance, and the ethical implications of their outputs. As we saw in “Provocations from the Humanities for Generative AI Research”, AI-generated content is never neutral as it reflects the biases and priorities of its creators and training data, which is especially problematic when working with colonial or otherwise loaded historical sources. Thus, although AI models can make our life easier by automating much of the work of handling data, it is still far from perfect when it comes to its efficiency and ethical considerations.

Another interesting reading that shaped my thinking was “Distant Viewing: Computational Exploration of Digital Images” by Arnold and Tilton. Their approach to “distant viewing” parallels the “distant reading” we practiced with textual corpora, but applying it to visual culture, analyzing thousands of movie posters to uncover genre conventions, color usage, and marketing strategies. Their work highlighted how computational methods can reveal large-scale patterns, but also how every step-from annotation to aggregation requires critical human judgment and awareness of context. This resonates with my own experience: whether mapping Zanzibar’s imports or analyzing Facebook group discourse, the choices I make in cleaning, coding, and visualizing data shape the narratives that emerge. Similarly, the article “How AI is Hijacking Art History,” reinforced the need for skepticism and critical engagement when using AI in creative or scholarly contexts.

On another note, one of the most rewarding aspects of my liberal arts education has been collaborating across different disciplines. Projects that combine historical analysis, data science, and creative media have broadened my understanding of what “computational thinking” can mean. It’s not just about efficiency or automation, it’s also about asking new questions, challenging assumptions, and remaining open to the unexpected. For instance, in our spatial data assignment, the concept of “distant viewing” helped me see how visualizing trade data could surface not just economic patterns, but also the colonial logic that organized Zanzibar’s place in the world. The process of building interactive maps in Kepler.gl, informed by critical readings and the professor’s instructions, exemplified the kind of reflective, interdisciplinary practice that digital humanities aspires to foster.

Therefore, as I reflect on my progress, I see digital literacy as an ongoing journey, one that demands technical agility, critical reflection, and ethical awareness. I am also particularly interested in exploring how emerging technologies like VR and AR might transform narrative and historical interpretation, and how I can use data science tools to tell more accurate, responsible stories. At the same time, I remain cautious about the promises of AI. While ChatGPT and similar models are improving, they are far from perfect, and their outputs must always be examined carefully for biases and errors. As the demand for AI models starts to increase even further, so does the responsibility of using them more carefully. Thus, by integrating the strengths of my liberal arts background with the possibilities of digital technology, and by grounding my practice in critical scholarship and collaborative inquiry, I hope to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible as a student, creator, and digital humanist.
