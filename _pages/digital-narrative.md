**Reflection on Digital Literacy as a 20-Year-Old Liberal Arts University Student**
<br/>

As a 20-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, digital literacy is not just a skill set—it’s a lens through which I navigate my academic, creative, and social worlds. In an era where technology permeates every aspect of life, being digitally literate means more than knowing how to use a computer or post on social media. It’s about understanding how to critically engage with digital tools, create meaningful content, and analyze data in ways that enrich my interdisciplinary studies. My journey through digital literacy has been shaped by my exposure to diverse fields like Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Literature, Creative Writing, and Art History. Each discipline has contributed to my evolving understanding of how digital tools can transform the way I think, create, and collaborate.

**Content Creation and Social Interaction**
<br/>

In my daily and academic life, I employ a variety of strategies for content creation and social interaction. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are not just spaces for entertainment; they are also tools for storytelling and self-expression. As a student of Film and New Media, I’ve learned to use Adobe Creative Suite—Premiere Pro for video editing, Photoshop for image manipulation, and After Effects for motion graphics—to create visually compelling projects. These tools allow me to blend narrative and aesthetics, whether I’m crafting a short film, designing a digital art piece, or producing a multimedia presentation for class.
For social interaction, I rely on platforms like Discord and Slack to communicate with peers and collaborate on group projects. These platforms are particularly useful for organizing interdisciplinary teams, where students from Computer Science, Interactive Media, and Literature might come together to work on a shared goal. For example, in a recent project, I collaborated with a Computer Science major to develop an interactive storytelling app. My role was to write the narrative and design the user interface, while my partner handled the coding. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication and the value of combining different skill sets to create something innovative.

**Research, Data Management, and Analysis**
<br/>

When it comes to research and data management, I’ve become proficient in using tools like Zotero and Mendeley to organize academic sources and generate citations. These tools are indispensable for writing research papers, especially in Literature and Art History, where I often need to reference a wide range of texts and images. For data manipulation and analysis, I’ve started exploring software like Excel, Tableau, and Python. While my skills in these areas are still developing, I’ve already seen how they can be applied to analyze trends in literature, visualize historical data, or even create interactive art installations.
In a course on Digital Humanities, I was introduced to the concept of “distant reading,” which uses computational methods to analyze large volumes of text. This approach has opened up new horizons for my studies in Literature and Creative Writing. By using tools like Voyant Tools or Python’s Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), I can identify patterns in texts that would be impossible to detect through close reading alone. For example, I recently analyzed a corpus of 19th-century novels to explore how themes of gender and power evolved over time. This project not only deepened my understanding of the texts but also gave me a new appreciation for the potential of computational methods in the humanities.

**Collaboration and Computational Thinking**
<br/>

One of the most exciting aspects of studying at a liberal arts university is the opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration. Working with students from different fields has expanded my understanding of “computational thinking,” as described by Berry and Fagerjord. This cognitive practice involves not just technical skills but also practical wisdom and reflection on how computation can be used to solve problems and create new knowledge. For example, in a collaborative project with an Art History major, we used 3D modeling software to recreate a historical artifact that had been lost to time. This project required both technical expertise and creative problem-solving, as we had to interpret fragmented historical records and translate them into a digital format.
Collaboration has also taught me the importance of approaching data and AI with a critical eye. In a world where algorithms shape everything from social media feeds to hiring practices, it’s crucial to understand how these systems work and how they can be biased. In a recent seminar on AI and ethics, I learned about the limitations of machine learning models and the ethical implications of using AI in creative fields. This has inspired me to explore new ways of thinking about data, not just as a tool for analysis but as a site of cultural and political significance.

**Critical Reflection and Future Directions**
<br/>

As I reflect on my current abilities, I realize that while I’ve made significant progress in digital literacy, there is still much to learn. I’m particularly interested in exploring how digital humanities can offer new perspectives on my studies in Literature and Creative Writing. For example, I’d like to experiment with generative AI tools like GPT-3 to create collaborative writing projects or explore how machine learning can be used to analyze poetic forms. I’m also curious about the potential of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) in storytelling and art. How might these technologies transform the way we experience narratives or interact with historical artifacts?
In terms of computational thinking, I want to deepen my understanding of programming languages like Python and R, as well as explore new tools for data visualization and analysis. I’m also keen to learn more about the ethical dimensions of AI and how I can use these technologies responsibly in my creative and academic work. Ultimately, I see digital literacy as a lifelong journey—one that requires continuous learning, critical reflection, and a willingness to embrace new ways of thinking. By combining the strengths of my liberal arts education with the possibilities of digital tools, I hope to push the boundaries of what I can achieve as a student, creator, and thinker.
